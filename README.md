# Mouse Sleep Auto Classification

Mammalian sleep consists of 3 distinct brain states: Wakefulness, REM (Rapid eye movement) sleep, and NREM (non-REM) sleep. These 3 states can be identified through inspection of EEG (electroencephalogram) and EMG (electromyogram) data. A major bottleneck in sleep research is that hours of sleep recordings have to be manually annotated by experts, a very time consuming process. Here, we will use deep neural networks to automatically classify sleep states based on EEG and EMG data obtained from mice. The data used for this project were made available by the dedicated researchers at the [Chung Lab](https://chunglab.med.upenn.edu/) and [Weber Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/weberlab/) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
